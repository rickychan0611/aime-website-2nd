            Your income largely depends on your skillset, talent, commitment, and hard work. Top performers on the platform can earn upwards of $20,000 per month. It is highly recommended to focus on broadcasting exclusively on our platform rather than spreading efforts across multiple sites, as this can dilute your focus, reduce your effectiveness, and result in dissatisfaction among viewers on each platform.

        </div>

        <div className="mb-8">
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">What should I do if I haven't received my wire transfer?</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Wire transfers usually take anywhere from 3 days to 2 weeks to process. If you have not received your transfer within this timeframe, please verify your payment details and get in touch with your bank. If it has been over two weeks and you still have not received the funds, please notify us using our contact form so we can trace the transaction through our partners. We can only reissue a transfer if it is returned to us, so it is crucial to provide accurate payment information.

          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-4">
            <li>Fraudulent activity: This includes situations where malicious users tip hosts excessively, or when a host is discovered to be cooperating with fraudulent users. Hosts are advised to report any suspicious activity in their rooms.</li>
            <li>User complaints regarding unsatisfactory performances: In these instances, we only return tokens to the user after thorough investigation.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Can I include links to my social media in my profile?</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            You are welcome to include your social media links in your profile. However, we recommend against sharing personal details such as your real name, phone number, or email address. Moreover, advertising other adult streaming services, sites offering alternative payment methods, fundraising sites that include links, text, logos, images, videos, or content sales websites is prohibited.

            <li>A reliable high-speed internet connection.</li>

          <p className="text-gray-700">
            To remove cookies and cache from your browser, please use the following guidelines: [Link to guidelines]
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">

          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Several issues might be causing the problem:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-4">
            <li>Lagging: Use a wired connection rather than Wi-Fi, which may not be stable enough for streaming. You might have too many unnecessary applications or browser tabs open, which could be overloading your processor. Shut down any applications and tabs that are not needed for your work. Flash accumulates many temporary files that can slow your browser. It's advisable to regularly clear your browser’s cache and cookies every week.</li>
            <li>Image is slow or blurry: This issue might be due to improper camera settings. Avoid making extensive adjustments to your camera settings.</li>
            <li>Pixelation and incorrect aspect ratio: This occurs if the resolution set in the splitter differs from the resolution you’ve chosen for your stream on the site. Always maintain consistent resolution settings.</li>
            <li>Blank camera screen: If your audience cannot see the webcam feed, halt the stream, pause for 2 minutes, refresh the page (hit F5 or FN + F5), and then resume streaming.</li>
            <li>Black camera screen: This might happen if no camera device is selected as the source on the website, or the wrong camera is chosen in the splitter. Confirm the correct video source is selected before you begin streaming and avoid selecting the camera that the splitter has chosen on the "Start Streaming" page.</li>
